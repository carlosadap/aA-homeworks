## Exercise 1 - Stack

Let's write a `Stack` class. To do this, use the following framework:

```ruby
  class Stack
    def initialize
      # create ivar to store stack here!
    end

    def push(el)
      # adds an element to the stack
    end

    def pop
      # removes one element from the stack
    end

    def peek
      # returns, but doesn't remove, the top element in the stack
    end
  end
```

To test that your code works, create a new instance of the Stack class, and play around with adding and removing elements. Remember, a stack follows the principle of LIFO!
